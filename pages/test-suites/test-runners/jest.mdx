You can record jest using `replay-node`. To do so:

1. Install `replay-node`, [as described here](/referrence-guide/recording/replay-node-(experimental)).
2. Run `replay-node --exec $jestCmd` to record the test. For example:
`replay-node --exec npm test` would record all of the tests run by the test script in your `package.json`, `replay-node --exec npm run test -- specific.test.ts` would pass “`specific.test.ts`” to `npm run test` and record that.
