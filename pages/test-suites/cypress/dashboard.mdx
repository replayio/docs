## Cypress Test Suite Dashboard
Your tests will be automatically recorded with every test run after you have integrated Replay into your CI.

You can view all your recordings in [Test Suite Dashboard](/test-suites/features/test-suite-dashboard). All your tests are grouped in with your test run.

### Test runs view
All your test runs can be filtered by branch name or with the search bar at the top. Every test run contains information on author, branch name and time of execution

### Test run detail
Clicking on the test run will reveal detailed view of all the tests within the test run. This view displays all the failed, passed and flaky tests. 

Clicking on any test file will take you into Replay DevTools, where you can start debugging your test execution using the [Cypress panel](/test-suites/cypress/cypress-panel).
