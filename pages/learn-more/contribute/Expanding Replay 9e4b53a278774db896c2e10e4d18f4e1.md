# Expanding Replay

Replay captures everything that happens while your application is recording. This is helpful for debugging, but the possible use cases for the data created are endless. 

The Replay Protocol and Record Driver APIs are both publicly documented so you can build out new applications to analyze and utilize recorded information. We’ve started with some open-source examples that measure Code Coverage and React Mount Detection.

If you have ideas for expanding how we use Replay, [let us know](https://www.notion.so/Contact-Community-096224a3bca4479b982ac572dc5c81d0?pvs=21) and we can add your example to the `protocol-examples` repo or answer any other questions!
