# Blog: Debugging Stately with Replay Node

In the example below, Mateusz Burzyński from Stately AI walks through the debugging process for [this bug](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/issues/3096). To investigate, he uses `replay-node`, which records a Node runtime without the browser to debug after the fact.

### The debugging process

In this issue, the function `interpreter.state.can()` always returns false when interpreting state stored as a JSON string in a DB. In the video and accompanying replay, you can see that this issue is caused because the `machine` property on the state is `undefined` when interpreting.

Mateusz traces the value of `machine` across multiple functions to identify why it is returning `undefined`. He uses multiple Replay features to trace and ultimately find the source of the bug:

- Call stack to navigate between called functions
- Stepping back, over, and into functions to isolate specific moments in time during execution
- Navigating between instances of a function call
- Hovering over source code to inspect values at that point in time
- Evaluating expressions in the console
