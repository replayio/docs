# Redux

## Overview

Redux DevTools in Replay is similar to the functionality of Redux DevTools in other browser developer tools. You can view the documentation for the library here for details on how to use.

Once enabled, the Replay Redux DevTools integration will show dispatched actions **up to the point in time you are paused in the replay.**
